    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <em>website for the Internet 
        <mark><del>(World Wide Web)</del></mark></em> or an <i>intranet</i> (a private network).<sup>[1]</sup> Web development can 
        range from developing a simple single <em>static page</em> of <em>plain text</em> to complex <em>web applications, 
        electronic businesses, and social network services</em>. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web 
        development commonly refers, may include <em>Web engineering, Web design, Web content development</em>, 
        client liaison, <i>client-side/server-side scripting, Web server</i> and <i>network security</i> configuration, 
        and <i>e-commerce</i> development.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the 
        main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <em>markup</em> and <em>coding.<sup>[2]</sup></em> Web development 
        may use <i>content management</i> systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of 
                hundreds of people (<i>Web developers</i>) and follow standard methods like <em>Agile methodologies</em> 
                while developing Web sites.<sup>[1]</sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or 
                contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <em>graphic 
                designer</em> or <em>information systems</em> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort 
                between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds 
                of Web developer specialization: <ins><i>front-end developer</i></ins>, back-end developer, 
                and full-stack developer.<sup>[3]</sup> Front-end developers are responsible for behavior 
                and visuals that run in the user browser, 
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, 
                the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
    <p><i><em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> created the <em>World Wide Web</em> in 1989 at CERN.<sup>[5]</sup></i></p>
    <dl>
        <ul>
            <li><dt>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated 
            information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various 
            global organizations. Consequently, <em>HTML</em> was developed in 1993.<sup>[6]</sup></dt></li>
            <dd>Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view 
            material and provide a small amount of information.<sup>[7]</sup> Core protocols of 
            web 1.0 were <em><mark>HTTP</mark></em>, HTML and <em>URI</em>.<sup>[8]</sup></dd>    
        </ul>    
    </dl>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
    <p><i>Web 2.0, a term popularised by <mark>Dale Doughertythen</mark> vice president 
        of <mark>O'Reilly</mark>, during a <em>2004</em> conference with Media Live, marks a shift 
        in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.<sup>[9][10]</sup></i></p>
    <dl>
        <ul>
            <li><dt>
                <em>Web 2.0</em> introduced increased user engagement and communication. 
                It evolved from the static, read-only nature of <em>Web 1.0</em> and became 
                an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often 
                referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.<sup>[7]</sup>
            </dt></li>
            <dd>In the realm of <em>Web 2.0</em> environments, users now have access to 
                a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating 
                music, files, images, and movies.<sup>[11]</sup> The architecture of <em>Web 2.0</em> 
                is often considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized 
                <em>XML</em> <del>(Extensible Markup Language)</del> tags to authorize information flow from 
                independent platforms and <em>online databases.<sup></sup></em></dd>
        </ul>
    </dl>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
    <p><i><em>Web 3.0</em>, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. 
        The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include 
        the integration of <em>metadata</em>, precise information delivery, and improved <em>user experiences</em> 
        based on preferences, history, and interests.<sup>[<em>citation needed</em>]</sup></i></p>
