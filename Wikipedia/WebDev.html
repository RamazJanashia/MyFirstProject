    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <em>website for the Internet 
        <mark><del>(World Wide Web)</del></mark></em> or an <i>intranet</i> (a private network).<sup>[1]</sup> Web development can 
        range from developing a simple single <em>static page</em> of <em>plain text</em> to complex <em>web applications, 
        electronic businesses, and social network services</em>. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web 
        development commonly refers, may include <em>Web engineering, Web design, Web content development</em>, 
        client liaison, <i>client-side/server-side scripting, Web server</i> and <i>network security</i> configuration, 
        and <i>e-commerce</i> development.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the 
        main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <em>markup</em> and <em>coding.<sup>[2]</sup></em> Web development 
        may use <i>content management</i> systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

        <div>
            <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of 
                hundreds of people (<i>Web developers</i>) and follow standard methods like <em>Agile methodologies</em> 
                while developing Web sites.<sup>[1]</sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or 
                contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <em>graphic 
                designer</em> or <em>information systems</em> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort 
                between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds 
                of Web developer specialization: <ins><i>front-end developer</i></ins>, back-end developer, 
                and full-stack developer.<sup>[3]</sup> Front-end developers are responsible for behavior 
                and visuals that run in the user browser, 
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, 
                the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
